## CNN(Convolution Neural Network)
In deep learning, a convolution neural network is a class of artificial neural network(ANN), most commonly applied to analyzed visual imagery. CNNs are also known as Shift Invariant or Space Invariant Artificial Neural Networks (SIANN). based on the shared-weight architecture of the convolution kernels or filters that slide along input features and provide translation-equivariant responses knowns as feature maps. Counter-intuitively, most convolution neural networks are only equivariant, as opposed to invariant, to translation. They have applications in image and video recognition, image segmentation, medical image analysis, natural language processing, brain-computer interfaces, and financial time series.
